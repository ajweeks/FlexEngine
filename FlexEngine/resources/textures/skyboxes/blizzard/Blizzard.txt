You do not have the right to convert this skybox to a lossy type like jpg. Sorry but if I waited for 4 days for it
 to render you can put up with the bigger cleaner files. Besides it only saves disk space, it takes just as much space
 in memory and and is actually slower to convert on the game engine.


This box was suggested by somebody on the forum at the Wadfather. He noticed that there was no forest skyboxes.
There is a reason for that in that making a entire forest is really difficult. Trees are huge poly pigs and having
hundreds of them in a scene and then rendering it is almost impossible. So I sugessted Mr. Gib give it a try to render !
Ha Ha, Well he seeing that comming countered with a challenge that we both should try to make one and the best sky wins
sort of. Well I couldn't put in the time so I declined at first. So Mr. Gib extended the deadline by a month. Low and 
behold I found the time and had it done by the original first date but Mr. Gib's skybox was no were to be seen.
So I just kept rendering it over and over again. Oh well we got lots of forests now !  They're all winter though.

 

Have Fun !

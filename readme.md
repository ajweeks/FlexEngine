# Flex Engine

[![MIT licensed](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue.svg)](LICENSE.md)

Flex Engine is my personal rendering engine which currently supports Vulkan and OpenGL. It was started in February 2017 as a way for me to better understand how graphics engines work.

#### Notable Features
- Support for both Vulkan and OpenGL, switchable at runtime

- Reflection probes
- Post-processing stage

#### Planned Features
 - Mesh animation
 - Cascading shadow maps

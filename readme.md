Flex Engine is my personal rendering engine which currently supports Vulkan and OpenGL. It was started in February 2017 as a way for me to better understand how graphics engines work.

#### Notable Features
- Support for both Vulkan and OpenGL, switchable at runtime
- Physically Based Rendering (PBR)
- Image Based lighting (IBL)
- Irradiance map generation
- Reflection probes
- Post-processing stage

#### Planned Features
 - Mesh animation
 - Cascading shadow maps
 - ...

## Building Flex (windows-only)
If you want to build Flex Engine on your own system, follow these steps. You an always download the latest release binaries [here](https://github.com/ajweeks/flexengine/releases) if that's what you're after.

#### Requirements:
- Visual Studio 2015
- [GENie](https://github.com/bkaradzic/GENie)

#### Steps
1. Recursively clone the repository using your method of choice (SourceTree, git bash, ...)
2. Ensure GENie is either on your PATH, or `genie.exe` is in the `/scripts` directory.
3. Navigate a command prompt to the `/scripts` directory and run `genie vs2015`
4. Open `build/FlexEngine.sln`
5. Build and run!

## Dependencies
Flex Engine uses the following open-source libraries:
 - [Assimp](https://github.com/assimp/assimp) - Model loading
 - [ImGui](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui) - User interface
 - [stb](https://github.com/nothings/stb) - Image loading
 - [glfw](https://github.com/glfw/glfw) - Window creation, input handling
 - [glad](https://github.com/Dav1dde/glad) - OpenGL profile loading
 - [glm](https://github.com/g-truc/glm) - Math operations
